# Simple-Voting-smart-contract

In this contract, there are two possible proposals (0 and 1) that can be voted for, and the votes mapping tracks the number of votes received for each proposal. The vote function accepts a proposal as an argument and increments the vote count for that proposal in the votes mapping. The winningProposal function returns the winning proposal by iterating through the votes mapping and finding the proposal with the highest number of votes.
